# PreCloud - Encrypt before upload

Encrypt your texts and files before uploading them to cloud.

**Everything is encrypted by the very well established algorithm PGP** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). The algorithm is used by [Proton](https://proton.me/), [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com/), [Encrypt.to](https://encrypt.to/) and many others.

**PreCloud has no server, everything happens on your phone** (your master password, the encryption process, the encrypted texts and files).
You can safely upload the encrypted texts or files to wherever you want, making any cloud provider an encrypted storage.

**Open source, no tracking and free forever.**

**NOTE**: Please keep your master password in a safe place, like a password manager. If you lose it, you can't decrypt your texts and files!

## What's coming next:
- [ ] Encrypt large files. Currently you can only encrypt files that are smaller than 20MB.
- [ ] Create web version. So you can also encrypt and decrypt on your laptop.
