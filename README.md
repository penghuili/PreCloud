# PreCloud - Encrypt before upload

Encrypt your texts and files before uploading them to cloud.

**Open source, no tracking and free forever.**

**PreCloud has no server, everything happens on your device.** (your master password, the encryption process, the encrypted texts and files)
You can safely upload the encrypted texts or files to wherever you want, making any cloud provider an encrypted storage.

**Everything is encrypted by the very well established algorithm PGP** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). The algorithm is used by [Proton](https://proton.me/), [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com/), [Encrypt.to](https://encrypt.to/) and many others.

**NOTE**: Please keep your master password in a safe place, like a password manager. If you lose it, you can't decrypt your texts and files!
