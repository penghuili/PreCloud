# PreCloud
PreCloud - Encrypt before upload.

Encrypt your texts and files before uploading them to cloud.

Everything is encrypted by the well established algorithm PGP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). It's used by Proton, Mailvolope, Encrypt.to and a lot of others.

PreCloud has no server, everything (your master password, the encryption process, the encrypted messages or files) happens on your phone. You can safely upload the encrypted messages or files to whereever you want.

Open sourced,Â no tracking and free forever.

Please keep your master password in a safe place, like a password manager. If you lose it, you can't decrypt your messages and files!
