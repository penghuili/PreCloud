# PreCloud - Encrypt before upload

PreCloud has no tracking, it's open sourced, you can check the code [here](https://github.com/penghuili/PreCloud).

PreCloud has no server, everything happens on your device. (your master password, the encryption process, the encrypted texts and files)
You can safely upload the encrypted texts or files to wherever you want, making any cloud provider an encrypted storage.

All your texts and files are encrypted with your master password via [openpgpjs](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs).

Your master password is saved in the secure storage on your phone ([Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services) on iOS and [Keystore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) on Android).
